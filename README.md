# flutter-bloc-practice
This repository is a practice project to learn and explore the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern in Flutter. The purpose of this project is to understand how to manage state in Flutter applications using the [`flutter_bloc` package](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) and combines implementations for the following: Counter App, Timer App, Infinite List, and Login Flow.

Check out the tutorials in the [BLoC documentation](https://bloclibrary.dev/getting-started/).
